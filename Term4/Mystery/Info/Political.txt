In September 25, 2015,

  Russian President Vladimir Dmitry was on his tour of Murmansk, gaining support for his election the following month.  
Exactly at 2000 hours, President Dmitry was in his suite when a fiery explosion blew the entire penthouse suite, along 
with the floor below, into oblivion.  There were 100 FSO agents killed on the floor below and 60 FSB agents on the floor 
above, along with the president.  The body was never recovered, most of the items were disintegrated.  Your mission, 
is to recover the body if possible as well as find out who murdered Dmitry and why they did it. Thank you for joining our
investigation task force. I have assembled a team for you on this mission. Natalia Prodonski, a thief, who pulled the recent 
heist to enter and steal the crown jewel. Devin Mitnick, a world-renowned hacker, last month he was able to hack into the US
Department of Defense and the British Parliament. Atwood Chaney, British fighter pilot and ace, who will provide gadgets for
this mission.

Sincerily,

Sergei Songu
